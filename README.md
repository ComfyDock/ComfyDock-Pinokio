## üåü **Why Use the Environment Manager?**

### **Common Challenges with ComfyUI**

- **Custom Node Installation Issues:** Installing new nodes can break your setup.
- **Workflow Compatibility:** Workflows often depend on specific custom nodes and ComfyUI versions.
- **Security Risks:** Directly installing custom nodes on your machine increases exposure to malicious code.

### **How This Tool Helps**

- **Environment Duplication:** Safely experiment with new setups by duplicating your current environment.
- **Environment Sharing:** Share and download pre-configured environments via DockerHub.
- **Enhanced Security:** Isolate ComfyUI in containers to protect your host machine.
